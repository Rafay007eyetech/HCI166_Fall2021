# USER SCENERIO 1 :

During covid situation all schools were closed and many students include Muhammad Akram facing issue in studying and many teachers observed that some students have non serious behaviour in there class by which every student were suffered from punishment . This is not acceptable for Muhammad Akram so he decide to ask for various teachers for this solution and told them about classroom debates which helps to student as well as teachers to evaluate every single student in class while studying however the solution is good but Akram didn't know how to implement in this environment so he decided to take help from her best friend.
