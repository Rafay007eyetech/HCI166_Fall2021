# IDEA : CLASSROOM DEBATES

# USER SCENERIO 3:

As Akram and Montana are friends so akram ask montana for help regarding his and other student problem which is that some student and Akram were facing difficulties in online learning. Montana was sure about that Akram will surely come and discuss this matter so she already decided the solution and told to Akram that we have to create an application which have video as well as audio conference with ask question option also there will be some sort of cross quiz platform for every student in class to know which student is active or non active. By this the problem will be solved for both sides; students and as well as for teachers. Akram feel happy and then both start working on this solution.
