Montana is good in everthing. She quickly learns anything whether it is for her benefit or not. Montana heard about the covid situation and she thinks that by closing schools no one can learn properly and may be teachers got disturbed while studying so she decided to find some sort of application which have video as well as audio conference with ask question option also there will be some sort of cross quiz platform for every student in class to know which student is active or non active.
