# IDEA : Ice breaker Questions

# USER SCENERIO 2 : 

Montana have facing issues  in online classes because only teacher is giving lecture and nobody in the class interacts with teacher. It didn't feel like a physical classes for montana because of this complete silence in the class. She have an idea that if teacher ask questions randomly from students in the middle of the lecture so student would take classes seriously and give attention properly.
